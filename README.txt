# LinCAS-lang

## What is it?
LinCAS wants to be a full object oriented programming language for math purposals with a built in symbolic CAS.

## Project status
This project has been developed to understand how the final one should look like
and the issues a such project comes with.

The language implementation in ruby is momentaneously suspended (I will implement it if it will be worth doing
and as soon as I'll have time).

To see the actual project check [crLinCAS](https://github.com/max-codeware/crLinCAS) implementation
in Crystal-lang, coosen for performances reasons and language features
